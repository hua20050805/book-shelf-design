# Book Shelf Design

This repository contains a Figma design for a book shelf page with the following features:

1. Add books: Support adding favorite novels to the bookshelf with one click, by searching for book titles, authors, or directly adding while browsing the book store.
2. Group management: Allow users to customize bookshelf groups, such as "Read", "Reading", "To Read", etc., to facilitate categorization and organization of a large number of books.
3. Reading progress display: Clearly show the reading progress of each book, usually in the form of percentage or chapter progress bar, allowing users to know where they left off at a glance.
4. Reading reminder settings: Users can set reading reminders for specific books to avoid missing updated chapters or wonderful content.
5. Book sorting: Provide multiple sorting methods, such as by addition time, reading frequency, update time, etc., to facilitate users to quickly find the books they want to read.
6. Delete and hide: Support deleting books that are no longer of interest from the bookshelf, or setting books to be hidden to keep the bookshelf tidy.
